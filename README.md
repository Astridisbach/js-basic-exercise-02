## JavaScript Task:

1. Link to the external JavaScript file placed in the `js` folder:
   ```html
   <script src="js/script.js"></script>
   ```
2. Ensure "use strict" is at the top of your `script.js` file.

3. Create a variable for your `[name]` and a variable for your `[age]` using `let`.

4. Use `console.log` to display the message:

   ```html
   "Hi [Name], you are [Age] years old!"
   ```

5. Reassign the `[name]` and `[age]` variables to new values, and display the updated message using `console.log`.
